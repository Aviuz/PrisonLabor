  Prison Labor mod for RimWorld
</p>

## Description
This mod force prisoners to work. To enable this feature prisoners must have "Force to work" option checked ("Prisoner" tab). Prison labor needs management that consist:
* Motivation - prisoners need to be motivated by presence of colonists. Wardens have new job - supervising prisoners. Low motivation can lead to revolts. Revolts are not available yet.
* Work assignment - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Work" tab.
* Time restrictions - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Restrict" tab.
* Prison area - prisoners in order to work need to reach target. You can check "Hold open" option on doors. Be aware, they will try to run if they see opportunity.
* "Prisoners only" tools - You can mark orders and bills by tools that exclude colonist from work.

## Beta
This is beta version. Some ascpects of mod still need to be balanced (like motivation). There can be still some bugs.

## Compatibility
* Works with mods that add Jobs of type cook/mine/craft/haul/clean like Quarry, or Haulers Can Haul To Blueprints
* Works with old saves.
* Disabling this mod to saves causes prisoners to disappear. In 0.7 I've planned tool to safely disable this mod.
* Now works with WorkTab (by Fluffy)
* There are some collisions that causes prisoners to fail to reserve target of their jobs. They will work on same thing or stealing resources from benches. If you experiencing this issue please le me know what mods are you using. I need to identify which mod causes that.
