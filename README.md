## Description
This mod force prisoners to work. To enable this feature prisoners must have "Force to work" option checked ("Prisoner" tab). Prison labor needs management that consist:
* Motivation - prisoners need to be motivated by presence of colonists. Wardens have new job - supervising prisoners. Low motivation can lead to revolts. Revolts are not available yet.
* Work assignment - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Work" tab.
* Time restrictions - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Restrict" tab.
* Prison area - prisoners in order to work need to reach target. You can check "Hold open" option on doors. Be aware, they will try to run if they see opportunity.
* "Prisoners only" tools - You can mark orders and bills by tools that exclude colonist from work.
