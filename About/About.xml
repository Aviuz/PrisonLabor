This mod force prisoners to work. To enable this feature prisoners must have "Force to work" option checked ("Prisoner" tab). Prison labor needs management that consist:
- Motivation - prisoners need to be motivated by presence of colonists. Wardens have new job - supervising prisoners. Low motivation can lead to revolts. Revolts are not available yet.
- Work assignment - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Work" tab.
- Time restrictions - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Restrict" tab.
- Prison area - prisoners in order to work need to reach target. You can check "Hold open" option on doors. Be aware, they will try to run if they see opportunity.
- "Prisoners only" tools - You can mark orders and bills by tools that exclude colonist from work. (Not available now)

This is early alpha version! Some features can be changed, and there are many that will be added. There can be bugs or compatibility collisions.

Currently to make prisoners work you must meet these conditions
- Prisoner is safe, and don't need medical assistance.
- Prisoner don't need to recover from injury/sickness in bed.
- Prisoner can't escape.
- Prisoner can reach work (best way to do that is leaving open doors to work area).
- Prisoner is fed, and rested.
- Prisoner interaction is set to "Work" (no "Chat and Recruit", or "Friendly Chat").
- Laziness bar in "Needs" tab is below 80%.
- Work type is enabled in "Work" tab.</description>
