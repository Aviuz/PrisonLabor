This mod force prisoners to work. To enable this feature prisoners must have "Force to work" option checked ("Prisoner" tab). Prison labor needs management that consist:
- Motivation - prisoners need to be motivated by presence of colonists. Wardens have new job - supervising prisoners. Low motivation can lead to revolts.
- Work assignment - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Work" tab.
- Time restrictions - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Restrict" tab.
- Prison area - prisoners in order to work need to reach target. You can check "Hold open" option on doors. Be aware, they will try to run if they see opportunity.
- "Prisoners only" tools - You can mark orders and bills by tools that exclude colonist from work.

This is beta version. Some ascpects of mod still need to be balanced (like motivation). There can be still some bugs.</description>
