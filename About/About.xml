This mod force prisoners to work if Prisoner Interaction is set to "Force to work".
Prisoner must be fed, and rested, or he(she) will refuse to work. Currently prisoners can only cook, mine, cut plants, craft, haul, clean and grow low-skilled plants.
Attention! He can run away if he mine a way out.

Prisoners need to be watched by wardens, or they will get lazy.

This is early alpha version, and it can be buggy.

To make prisoners work you must meet these conditions:
- Prisoner is safe, and don't need medical assistance.
- Prisoner don't need to recover from injury/sickness in bed.
- Prisoner can't escape.
- Prisoner can reach work (best way to do that is leaving open doors to work area).
- Prisoner is fed, and rested.
- Prisoner interaction is set to "Force to work" (no "Chat and Recruit", or "Friendly Chat").
- Laziness bar in "Needs" tab is below 80%</description>
