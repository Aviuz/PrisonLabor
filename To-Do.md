# TO-DO
In this section I will describe some major changes that I plan to implement. This list is dynamic and will change eventually.
Minor issues, bugs, and others can be found [here](../../issues).
## Pawn attributes & Motivation & Treatment happiness
- There will be more adjustments to how quickly pawn is beign motivated, how fast he is going to be lazy etc.
- Motivation will be increased with high social/combat power of warden
- Prisoners will be able to do forbidden jobs, but:
- Prisoners will get more lazy if doing jobs that they do not like.
- Prisoners will get more lazy if they are working in bad conditions.
- Prisoners will get less treat. happiness when their faction is at very bad stance with player's faction.
## Treatment
- I will add new need "Treatment" or "Treatment happiness"(by default hidden, changeable via settings if possible). It will indicate "how good" prisoners are treated. This will make boost to mood, and will reduce chance of revolts.[/li]
- Free time, or joy time will now give very little motivation boost, but instead it will give treatment happiness.
- Treatment will be reduced when pawn is working, when he's been hit, or when it has been forced to live in bad condition (human meat, bad food, no bed etc.)
- Low treatment will provide mental break BONUS. Keeping prisoners on low treatment can be beneficial too.
## Recruiting
- On high treatment there will be chance of letter with offer from prisoner to join colony. This option can exclude wardens as recruiters.
- Low treatment can reduce chance of recruiting.
## Forbidden items & Hypothermia
- Prisoners will be respecting forbidden items, but only nearby colonists. You still need to control where prisoners can go, and where not, but it will be easier to micro-manage some exceptions.[/li]
- Prisoners will seek safe temperature, if not being supervised. If so, they will be icon above head indicating that you're forcing prisoners to work in cold.
- Prisoners will occasionally pick up laying weapons and try to fight on their own. May cause revolt. High treatment can reduce chance.
## Bugs
- Top priority is for now bug with no-working colonists/prisoners. I'll take some actions to fix as many cases as possible.
- Currently I'm not aware of any compatibility issues expect Cleaning Area (which is lost case)
- The loading save bug with "OnGui()" message in error log.
## Construction work type
- This a big "bug" that forbids prisoners to build stuff. I know lot of you are very unhappy of that fact you cannot force prisoners to build.

Those changes will be implemented in **future** versions, and I need some time for them. But letting you know, on what I am currently working on.
