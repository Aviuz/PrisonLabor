# TO-DO
In this section I will describe some major changes that I plan to implement. This list is dynamic and will change eventually.
Minor issues, bugs, and others can be found [here](../../issues).

## Treatment
- I will add new need "Treatment" or "Treatment happiness"(by default hidden, changeable via settings if possible). It will indicate "how good" prisoners are treated. This will make boost to mood, and will reduce chance of revolts.[/li]
- Free time, or joy time will now give very little motivation boost, but instead it will give treatment happiness.
- Treatment will be reduced when pawn is working, when he's been hit, or when it has been forced to live in bad condition (human meat, bad food, no bed etc.)
- Low treatment will provide mental break BONUS. Keeping prisoners on low treatment can be beneficial too.
## Recruiting
- On high treatment there will be chance of letter with offer from prisoner to join colony. This option can exclude wardens as recruiters.
- Low treatment can reduce chance of recruiting.
## Forbidden items & Hypothermia
- Prisoners will be respecting forbidden items, but only nearby colonists. You still need to control where prisoners can go, and where not, but it will be easier to micro-manage some exceptions.[/li]
- Prisoners will seek safe temperature, if not being supervised. If so, they will be icon above head indicating that you're forcing prisoners to work in cold.
- Prisoners will occasionally pick up laying weapons and try to fight on their own. May cause revolt. High treatment can reduce chance.
## Bugs
- Top priority is for now bug with no-working colonists/prisoners. I'll take some actions to fix as many cases as possible.
- Currently I'm not aware of any compatibility issues expect Cleaning Area (which is lost case)
- The loading save bug with "OnGui()" message in error log.

Those changes will be implemented in **future** versions, and I need some time for them. But letting you know, on what I am currently working on.
